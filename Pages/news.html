                            <p>Martin Luther King’s words are instructive of the spirit that brings us 
all into this room today. We are more than the sum of our individual ambitions; we are indeed “caught 
in an inescapable network of mutuality,” and as such we have commitments to those in our neighborhoods
, our communities, this city, this nation, and indeed the world. But I think more than that, 
King’s example demonstrates how we should understand ourselves as members of the University 
of Chicago community.
As members of the UChicago community, we all are indebted—well, some of us literally—but all of us are 
indebted to this institution because we have been afforded opportunities, knowledge, and new ways of 
thinking that form a portion of our identity. I don’t need to remind you of the astounding work our 
alumni have done throughout the past century or so. It is because of their legacy that we have inherited 
this magnificent institution.
